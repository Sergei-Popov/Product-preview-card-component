# Solution Retrospective

## What are you most proud of?

**CSS Architecture:**
- Applied BEM methodology for maintainable and readable code
- Used CSS Custom Properties for centralized design system management
- Implemented modular file structure for better scalability

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with well-thought-out breakpoints
- Utilized `<picture>` element for optimized image performance
- Conditionally disabled decorative effects on mobile for better UX

**Implementation Quality:**
- Achieved pixel-perfect design accuracy
- Applied advanced CSS effects (`text-shadow`, `-webkit-text-stroke`)
- Created smooth interactive hover states

## What would you do differently next time?

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implement CSS minification and bundle optimization
- Use modern image formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Add lazy loading for media content

**Accessibility Improvements:**
- Include ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Enhance focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Test color contrast compliance with WCAG 2.1

**Technology Stack:**
- Utilize CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Implement Container Queries for component-based responsiveness
- Use CSS preprocessor (Sass/SCSS) for DRY principles

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

**Typography Readability on Mobile:**
- **Challenge:** Text shadow and stroke effects made text hard to read on small screens
- **Solution:** Used media queries to conditionally remove decorative effects on mobile devices, prioritizing readability over visual flair

**Image Responsiveness:**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring optimal image display across different screen sizes and orientations
- **Solution:** Implemented `<picture>` element with `<source>` to serve different images for desktop and mobile, maintaining visual quality while optimizing performance

**Layout Flexibility:**
- **Challenge:** Switching from horizontal to vertical card layout on mobile while maintaining proper spacing
- **Solution:** Used Flexbox with `flex-direction` changes in media queries and adjusted border-radius properties for seamless visual transition

**Cross-browser Compatibility:**
- **Challenge:** Webkit-specific properties might not work consistently across all browsers
- **Solution:** Added fallback styles and used progressive enhancement approach, ensuring basic functionality works everywhere while advanced features enhance the experience in supporting browsers

**Precise Design Matching:**
- **Challenge:** Achieving exact spacing and typography without design system specifications
- **Solution:** Used CSS Custom Properties to maintain consistency and employed visual comparison with design mockups to fine-tune measurements iteratively
